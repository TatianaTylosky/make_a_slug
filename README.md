This is a python I created that will take any string and make it slug appropriate.

  Slugs have '-' instead of spaces and are entirely lower case.

If you would like to use this little slug program here are some super simple instruactions:

  #1 Make a copy of this file into whatever file you are working in.
  #2 Type 'from slug import slug' at the top of the python file you would like to use this slug function in.
  #3 Call the function on your string by typing 'slug("this is my crazy string")'.

SLUG AWAY
